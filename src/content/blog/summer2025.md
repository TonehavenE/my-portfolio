This summer has been one of the busiest and most rewarding periods of my life. I balanced two major jobs, both requiring me to live away from home, a week-long physics conference, and still found time for family and friends. Here are some of the key lessons I learned along the way.

## Interdisciplinary Learning is Invaluable

The first part of my summer was spent working as a research assistant in Lund, Sweden, on a project involving butterfly phylogenetics. The idea is to use the genetic data of butterflies to understand their evolutionary relationships and aid in identification. This work was a fascinating blend of biology, computer science, and statistics. I learned how to use various bioinformatics tools and programming languages to analyze genetic sequences and construct phylogenetic trees. Here's the catch: I know nothing about biology or butterflies. My background is in physics and engineering. However, I found that my skills in programming and data analysis were highly transferable. I found analogs between the statistical and linear algebra methods used in bioinformatics and those I had learned in my physics courses. I was able to leverage my past experience to contribute meaningfully to the project, despite my lack of domain-specific knowledge. This experience reinforced the idea that interdisciplinary learning is invaluable. The ability to adapt and apply skills across different fields is a powerful asset in today's rapidly evolving scientific landscape. 

## Teaching is the Best Way to Learn

I spent the second half of my summer working as a teaching assistant at Jane Street's [Academy of Math and Programming (AMP)](https://www.janestreet.com/join-jane-street/programs-and-events/amp/) in New York City. AMP is a phenomenal opportunity for incoming college freshman to get exposure to a variety of technical topics. I had the pleasure of teaching there this summer. My role was to assist students and foster a collaborative learning environment with a focus on communication and careful problem-solving. I found that teach others was by far the best way to solidify my own understanding of the material. Explaining concepts to students forced me to break down complex ideas into simpler components, which deepened my comprehension. Additionally, I learned a lot from the students themselves. Their fresh perspectives and unique approaches to problem-solving often challenged my own thinking and encouraged me to think more creatively. 

## Don't be Afraid to Step Outside Your Comfort Zone

If you told me last year that I would be spending my summer in Sweden working on butterfly genetics, I would have laughed. Yet, here I am, having had an incredible experience that has broadened my horizons and expanded my skill set. This summer taught me the importance of stepping outside my comfort zone and embracing new challenges. Whether it was navigating a foreign country, learning new technical skills, or adapting to different work environments, I found that growth often comes from discomfort. By pushing myself to try new things, I discovered strengths and capabilities that I didn't know I had. The world is huge and filled with oppurtunities. Don't be afraid to explore. 

## Rest is Crucial

Through it all, I learned the importance of rest and self-care. Balancing all this often left me exhausted, both physically and mentally. I realized that taking time to recharge was crucial for maintaining my productivity and overall well-being. Whether it was a walk in the park, a weekend with family, or simply a quiet evening with a book, these moments of rest allowed me to return to my work with renewed energy and focus. Don't neglect rest. It is just as important as hard work.

## Conclusion

I'm looking forward to putting these lessons into practice as I continue my academic and professional journey. This summer has been a whirlwind of experiences, but the lessons I've learned will undoubtedly shape my approach to learning, work, and life in the years to come. Here's to embracing new challenges, fostering interdisciplinary connections, and always making time for rest and reflection.
