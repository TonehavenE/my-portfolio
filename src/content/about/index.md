title: "About Me"
subtitle: "Engineering Physics Student & Researcher"
---

I'm an engineering physics student with a passion for tackling some of the most challenging problems in science and technology. My work spans multiple disciplines, from developing satellite systems for NASA to studying the evolutionary patterns of butterfly species through phylogenetics.

## Research Interests

My research interests include:

- **Complex Fluid Dynamics**: Non-Newtonian fluid behavior and turbulent flow patterns
- **Magnetohydrodynamics (MHD)**: Plasma physics applications and fusion reactor dynamics  
- **Satellite Technology**: Orbital mechanics, attitude control, and mission planning
- **Computational Biology**: Phylogenetics and evolutionary analysis
- **Applied Mathematics**: Numerical methods and mathematical modeling

## Philosophy

I believe in the power of interdisciplinary approaches to solve real-world problems and am always excited to explore new frontiers in physics and engineering. The intersection of theoretical understanding and practical application drives my work, whether I'm optimizing satellite trajectories or analyzing genomic data.

## Teaching & Mentoring

When I'm not solving equations or writing code, you can find me teaching and mentoring other students, sharing the excitement of discovery that drives my work. I'm passionate about making complex concepts accessible and inspiring the next generation of scientists and engineers.
