I love building input devices. The things that we use to make computers go, essentially. In exploring input devices, I stumbled into the world of ergonomic mechanical keyboards, or "ergomechs," a niche community ripe with ideas and innovation about how to more comfortably type words. I was immediately hooked.

After trying a couple of existing designs, I decided that nothing really suited me. So I set out to make my own keyboards. Over the following couple years, I went on a journey to learn the tools and skills necessary to build and create keyboards, including KiCAD for designing PCBs, soldering, Fusion 360 for creating cases, 3D printing, and the C programming language to write firmware.

Here are all of my keyboard projects:
