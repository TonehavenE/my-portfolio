# 3UCubed

3UCubed is a 3U CubeSAT being developed by a collaboration of students from the University of New Hampshire, Howard University, and Sonoma State University. The satellite is part of NASA's IMAP Student Collaboration, which aims to provide students with hands-on experience in designing, building, and operating a CubeSAT mission. The mission's primary objective is to study the interaction between the solar wind using two student-built and calibrated instruments: a ultraviolet photomultiplier tube and a electron retarding potenial analyzer. 

The satellite is scheduled to launch in Q4 2025. I have worked on the physical assembly of the satellite, as well as the calibration of the UV photomultiplier tube instrument. The project has provided me with valuable experience in satellite design, integration, and testing, as well as a deeper understanding of heliophysics and space weather.
