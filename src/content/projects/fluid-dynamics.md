# Complex Fluid Dynamics Research

## Project Overview

This research focuses on understanding the behavior of complex fluids, including non-Newtonian fluids, multiphase flows, and turbulent systems. The work combines theoretical analysis, computational fluid dynamics (CFD), and experimental validation to advance our understanding of fluid mechanics in engineering applications.

## Theoretical Framework

### Navier-Stokes Equations

The fundamental equations governing fluid motion are the Navier-Stokes equations:

**Continuity Equation:**
$$\frac{\partial \rho}{\partial t} + \nabla \cdot (\rho \vec{u}) = 0$$

**Momentum Equation:**
$$\frac{\partial \vec{u}}{\partial t} + (\vec{u} \cdot \nabla)\vec{u} = -\frac{1}{\rho}\nabla p + \nu \nabla^2 \vec{u} + \vec{f}$$

For incompressible flow ($\nabla \cdot \vec{u} = 0$), these simplify considerably.

### Non-Newtonian Fluid Models

#### Power-Law Model
$$\tau = K \left(\frac{du}{dy}\right)^n$$

Where $n < 1$ for shear-thinning fluids and $n > 1$ for shear-thickening fluids.

#### Bingham Plastic Model
$$\tau = \tau_0 + \mu_p \frac{du}{dy} \quad \text{for } |\tau| > \tau_0$$

## Computational Methods

### Finite Volume Method

The governing equations are discretized using the finite volume method:

```matlab
function [u, v, p] = solve_navier_stokes(u0, v0, p0, dt, dx, dy, Re)
    % Solve incompressible Navier-Stokes equations
    % using SIMPLE algorithm
    
    [nx, ny] = size(u0);
    u = u0; v = v0; p = p0;
    
    % Momentum equations
    for iter = 1:max_iter
        % U-momentum
        u_star = solve_u_momentum(u, v, p, dt, dx, dy, Re);
        
        % V-momentum  
        v_star = solve_v_momentum(u, v, p, dt, dx, dy, Re);
        
        % Pressure correction
        [p_prime, u, v] = pressure_correction(u_star, v_star, p, dt, dx, dy);
        
        p = p + p_prime;
        
        % Check convergence
        if max(abs(p_prime(:))) < tolerance
            break;
        end
    end
end
```

### Turbulence Modeling

#### Reynolds-Averaged Navier-Stokes (RANS)

For turbulent flows, we solve the Reynolds-averaged equations with closure models:

**k-Îµ Model:**
$$\frac{\partial k}{\partial t} + U_j \frac{\partial k}{\partial x_j} = P_k - \varepsilon + \frac{\partial}{\partial x_j}\left[\left(\nu + \frac{\nu_t}{\sigma_k}\right)\frac{\partial k}{\partial x_j}\right]$$

$$\frac{\partial \varepsilon}{\partial t} + U_j \frac{\partial \varepsilon}{\partial x_j} = C_{1\varepsilon}\frac{\varepsilon}{k}P_k - C_{2\varepsilon}\frac{\varepsilon^2}{k} + \frac{\partial}{\partial x_j}\left[\left(\nu + \frac{\nu_t}{\sigma_\varepsilon}\right)\frac{\partial \varepsilon}{\partial x_j}\right]$$

#### Large Eddy Simulation (LES)

For high-fidelity simulations, LES resolves large-scale turbulent structures:

$$\frac{\partial \bar{u_i}}{\partial t} + \frac{\partial}{\partial x_j}(\bar{u_i}\bar{u_j}) = -\frac{1}{\rho}\frac{\partial \bar{p}}{\partial x_i} + \nu \frac{\partial^2 \bar{u_i}}{\partial x_j^2} - \frac{\partial \tau_{ij}}{\partial x_j}$$
