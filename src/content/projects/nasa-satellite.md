# NASA Satellite Systems Project

## Overview

This project involves the development and analysis of satellite control systems for NASA's next-generation Earth observation missions. My work focuses on attitude determination and control systems (ADCS), orbital mechanics calculations, and mission planning optimization.

## Key Components

### Attitude Determination and Control

The spacecraft attitude is determined using a combination of:
- Star trackers for high-precision attitude determination
- Inertial Measurement Units (IMUs) for attitude rate sensing
- Magnetometers for geomagnetic field reference
- GPS receivers for position and velocity determination

The angular momentum equation governs the rotational dynamics:

$$\vec{L} = \vec{r} \times m\vec{v} = I\vec{\omega}$$

Where $\vec{L}$ is the angular momentum, $I$ is the moment of inertia tensor, and $\vec{\omega}$ is the angular velocity vector.

### Orbital Mechanics

The satellite's orbital motion is governed by the two-body problem with perturbations:

$$\frac{d^2\vec{r}}{dt^2} = -\frac{\mu}{r^3}\vec{r} + \vec{a}_{pert}$$

Major perturbations include:
- Atmospheric drag
- Solar radiation pressure  
- Earth's gravitational harmonics
- Third-body gravitational effects

### Control System Design

The attitude control system uses reaction wheels and magnetorquers:

```cpp
class AttitudeController {
    Vector3 computeControlTorque(const Quaternion& q_desired, 
                                const Quaternion& q_current,
                                const Vector3& omega_current) {
        // PID control implementation
        Vector3 error = quaternionToEuler(q_desired * q_current.conjugate());
        Vector3 torque = Kp * error - Kd * omega_current;
        return saturate(torque, MAX_TORQUE);
    }
};
```

## Mission Applications
